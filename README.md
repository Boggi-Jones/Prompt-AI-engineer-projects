# Discord Bot
In this I made a simple discord bot that would get a message to talk to the Discord Chatbot local agent. That agent would either answer the question or send it forward to the Game randomiser agent.
That agent would either send it to Warhammer randomiser or the Civ randomiser. Then I have a Random number generator since the ai was never good at being random.
